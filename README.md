## 📌 Project Description

This is an Excel-based dashboard project that analyzes Spotify streaming data in India using dummy data.

The purpose of the project is to:
- Practice data cleaning and dashboard creation in Excel
- Build interactive visualizations using slicers and charts
- Show insights such as top artists, songs, genres, and region-wise trends

The dashboard includes filters (slicers) for **genre**, **year**, and **artist** so that users can explore the data easily.

This project helped me improve my skills in Excel charts, pivot tables, and layout design.
